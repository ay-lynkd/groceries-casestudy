# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   **Without Android SDK:** run on web or iOS instead:
   - **Web:** `npx expo start --web` then press `w`, or run `npm run web`
   - **iOS (macOS only):** `npx expo start --ios` or press `i` in the menu

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Troubleshooting

### Android: "Failed to resolve the Android SDK path" / "spawn adb ENOENT"

Android SDK isn’t installed or `ANDROID_HOME` isn’t set.

1. **Install Android Studio** (includes the SDK): [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. **Set `ANDROID_HOME`** in your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

3. Restart the terminal, run `npx expo start`, then press `a` for Android.

Until then, use **web** (`npm run web`) or **iOS** (`npm run ios`, macOS only).
